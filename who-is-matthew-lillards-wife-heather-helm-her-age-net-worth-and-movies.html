This was also where her family raised her. The realtor was born on the 17th day of July 1971 and is now 52 years old. Her star sign is Cancer. Heather is reported to be a very nurturing, sensitive, and intuitive person, and these traits are often associated with this zodiac sign.</p><p>According to our findings, she was born to a father called Hugh Helm. However, her mother’s name is not certain. Not much is known about Heather’s days as a child and what she did growing up as details about this period of her life are relatively scarce.</p><p>Some reports say she is not an only child, as she has siblings with whom she grew up in Glendale. However, the identities of her siblings remain vague at the moment. But, she is fond of sharing images of family members on her social media page, showing how close she is to them.</p><h3><strong>She Studied at the University of California, Los Angeles&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Heather Helm has always shown a keen interest in academics and is now a woman with a strong educational background. Reports say even in her early years, there were clear indications of her passion for academics. Our research reveals that she pursued her secondary education at La Cañada High School, an esteemed institution that caters to both junior and senior students.</p><p>After successfully completing her high school education, Heather’s thirst for knowledge led her to the prestigious University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). This renowned institution allowed her to further develop her intellectual capabilities and expand her horizons. During her time at UCLA, Heather majored in Political Science and eventually graduated with a degree in Political Science.</p><p>There are reports that she tried to go for a Master’s degree, but this has not been independently verified. What is certain is that Heather is a well-read woman who knows her onions.</p><h2><strong>How Heather Helm Met Her Husband, Matthew Lillard</strong></h2><p>As we have already explained, Heather Helm is now married to American actor Matthew Lillard. Their paths first crossed at a party in the late 1990s, with some reports suggesting that the year was 1998. Upon laying eyes on Heather, the actor was captivated by her beauty, but he did not immediately make a move.</p><p>As fate would have it, Matthew discovered that one of Heather’s friends was soon to be married and that Heather was going to be at the wedding. Matthew saw this as an opportunity to spend more time with her so, determined to establish a connection, he invited himself to the wedding, hoping to catch Heather’s attention and engage in conversation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/06/Heather.jpg><p>His plan succeeded because he met Heather at the wedding and finally made his move to talk to her. As they talked, they discovered they had a mutual attraction for each other because, as it turned out, Heather had also taken note of him before. This marked the beginning of their romantic journey as they officially became a couple shortly thereafter.</p><p>Heather and Matthew found common ground in their shared interests and passions, particularly their love for the arts and comedy. This strong connection fostered a deep bond between them, and they became virtually inseparable. Reports even suggest that Heather accompanied Matthew to some of his movie locations while they were dating, illustrating the depth of their commitment and support for one another.</p><p>At the time, Matthew was rapidly rising as a prominent movie star, and he embraced Heather’s presence in his life, including her in his professional endeavors.</p><h2><strong>Heather Helm Has Been&nbsp;</strong><strong>Matthew Lillard’s Wife For</strong><strong>&nbsp;23 Years</strong></h2><p>After dating for almost two years, Heather Helm and Matthew Lillard finally decided to get married. Eventually, they exchanged their vows and tied the knot on August 26, 2000. While specific details regarding the venue and the intricacies of their wedding remain undisclosed, it is believed that the couple celebrated their union in the presence of their loved ones, including family, friends, and even some fellow celebrities.</p><p>Following their nuptials, Matthew Lillard, recognizing the importance of spending quality time with his new wife, took a small break from his busy movie career. This break allowed the newlyweds to savor the initial stages of their marital bliss and nurture their relationship without the distractions of work.
